🚀 Elevate Pro – CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions, Docker & Terraform (Azure)
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline implementation for a sample Python web application.
The pipeline automates the process of building, testing, containerizing, and deploying the application on Azure using GitHub Actions, Docker, and Terraform.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python 3.12

CI/CD: GitHub Actions

Containerization: Docker & DockerHub

Infrastructure as Code: Terraform

Cloud Provider: Microsoft Azure

Monitoring & Logging: Azure Monitor & Log Analytics

⚙️ Pipeline Workflow
🔹 Continuous Integration (CI)

Triggered on push or pull request to main.

Runs:

Linting (flake8, black, isort)

Unit Tests (pytest)

Builds Docker image and pushes it to DockerHub.

🔹 Continuous Deployment (CD)

Triggered after CI passes.

Uses Terraform to:

Provision required Azure infrastructure.

Deploy the containerized application to Azure (Container Apps / App Service).

Provides a public URL to access the app.

🚀 Getting Started
🔧 Local Development
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run tests
pytest -q

🐳 Build & Run with Docker
# Build image
docker build -t <your-dockerhub-username>/elevate-pro-cicd:latest .

# Run container
docker run -p 8000:8000 <your-dockerhub-username>/elevate-pro-cicd:latest


Access app at → http://localhost:8000

🌐 Deployment on Azure

Deployment is fully automated with Terraform and GitHub Actions.

Push changes to the main branch.

GitHub Actions will:

Run CI checks.

Build & push Docker image to DockerHub.

Apply Terraform to provision Azure infra.

Deploy the app and provide a public URL.

✅ Final result: Application accessible over the internet.

📊 Monitoring & Logging

Logs available via Azure Monitor and Log Analytics.

Terraform integration allows configuring:

CPU/Memory usage alerts

Application error tracking

Performance insights with Application Insights

🔒 Security Considerations

GitHub Secrets are used for DockerHub & Azure credentials.

Terraform state is stored securely (recommended: remote backend with Azure Storage).

Role-based access control (RBAC) is enforced via Azure AD.

✨ Key Learnings

Setting up an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions.

Managing cloud infrastructure with Terraform.

Deploying containerized applications on Azure.

Automating security, testing, and monitoring into the pipeline.
